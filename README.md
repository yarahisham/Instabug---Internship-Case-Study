This is the problem I was given to solve during the internship hiring process. 
# **Problem**
I work in Instabug as a squad manager. My responsibility is to handle a squad of 60 members. There are 2 squad member A and B:
-	A has an extrovert personality, is a team player, always help his team member and those around him, mentors others and pass down his knowledge and experience, but his work productivity is measured as being only 60%.
-	B has an introverted personality, is not a team player, doesnâ€™t help those around him as he is only focused to achieve his own requirements perfectly and on time, his work productivity is measured as being 100%.

My manager requested that I have to solve this situation and fire one of the 2 squad members and the time span for taking such a decision is 3 months.
